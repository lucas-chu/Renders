# Met Museum 3D Scan Downloader

Downloads 3D scans from The Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection via their Vntana-hosted assets. Models are CC0 (public domain) under the Met's Open Access policy.

## Quick start

### 1. Get object IDs

The included `object_ids.txt` has all ~129 objects with 3D scans as of March 2026. To refresh:

```bash
for offset in 0 40 80 120; do
  curl -s "https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search?showOnly=has3d&offset=${offset}&perPage=40" \
    | grep -oP '/art/collection/search/(\d+)' | grep -oP '\d+'
done | sort -un > object_ids.txt
```

### 2. Download models

Single object:
```bash
./met-dl.sh 547802           # GLB (default)
./met-dl.sh 547802 fbx       # FBX
./met-dl.sh 547802 all       # all formats (GLB, FBX, USDZ)
./met-dl.sh https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/547802  # URL also works
```

All objects:
```bash
./batch-dl.sh glb             # download all as GLB
```

The batch script is resumable — it skips files that already exist.

### 3. Verify downloads

```bash
# count files and total size
ls *.glb | wc -l
du -shc *.glb | tail -1

# check a specific file isn't corrupted (needs blender CLI or gltf-validator)
npx gltf-validator somefile.glb
```

### 4. Build metadata catalog

```bash
./build-catalog.sh
```

Produces `catalog.json` with full Met API metadata (title, artist, date, medium, dimensions, culture, period, etc.) and Vntana asset info (filenames, download URLs, poly counts) for every object.

## What you get

- **Format:** GLB (glTF-binary), also FBX and USDZ available
- **Poly count:** ~100k per model (Vntana-decimated from originals that range 1M–35M)
- **Textures:** Baked, embedded in the GLB
- **License:** CC0 public domain
- **Total size:** ~600 MB for all GLBs
